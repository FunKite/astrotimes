---

## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Repository Settings Applied

### Automated via GitHub API ‚úÖ

1. **Delete branch on merge**: `true`
   - Automatically cleans up feature branches after merging
   - Keeps repository tidy

2. **Issues**: Enabled
   - Users can report bugs and request features

3. **Projects**: Enabled
   - For internal project management

4. **Discussions**: Disabled
   - Reduces overhead, Issues are sufficient

5. **Wiki**: Disabled
   - Documentation is versioned in `docs/` directory

### Settings That Require Manual Configuration

Located in `.github/REPOSITORY_SETTINGS.md` with full instructions:

1. **Branch Protection** (requires GitHub Pro for private repos)
   - Allow force pushes (for maintainer)
   - Prevent branch deletion
   - No PR requirements

2. **Security Features**
   - Enable Dependabot alerts
   - Enable Dependabot security updates
   - Enable dependency graph

3. **Repository Metadata**
   - Update description
   - Add topics (rust, astronomy, cli, etc.)
   - Add issue labels

### Settings NOT Available (API Limitation)

- **Allow Forking**: Cannot be disabled for user-owned private repositories
  - Only available for organization-owned repositories
  - Not a concern since PRs won't be accepted anyway
  - Users can fork to experiment locally (doesn't affect our workflow)

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Immediate (Already Done)
- ‚úÖ Update all documentation
- ‚úÖ Create GitHub issue templates
- ‚úÖ Create PR template
- ‚úÖ Apply automated repository settings
- ‚úÖ Document manual settings requirements

### To Do (Manual Web Interface)

1. **Configure Security Settings** (5 minutes)
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Code security and analysis
   - Enable Dependabot alerts
   - Enable Dependabot security updates
   - Enable Dependency graph

2. **Update Repository Metadata** (2 minutes)
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí About
   - Update description: "High-precision astronomical calculations CLI - Sun/Moon rise/set times, twilight, and lunar phases"
   - Add topics: `rust`, `astronomy`, `cli`, `astronomical-calculations`, `solar-position`, `lunar-phases`, `ephemeris`, `terminal-ui`

3. **Create Issue Labels** (optional, 3 minutes)
   - `documentation` - Improvements to documentation
   - `question` - Further information requested
   - `wontfix` - This will not be worked on
   - `duplicate` - This issue already exists
   - Note: `bug` and `enhancement` are created automatically by templates

4. **Branch Protection** (optional, requires GitHub Pro)
   - If you have GitHub Pro, follow guide in `.github/REPOSITORY_SETTINGS.md`
   - Not critical for maintainer-only development
