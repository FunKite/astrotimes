## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior in any GitHub space, please report it directly to GitHub Support under their [Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines). For project-specific issues, you may also contact the repository owner privately if you feel comfortable doing so.

Please remember that this is a volunteer open-source project. We expect participants to act in good faith and help maintain a kind, constructive atmosphere.
