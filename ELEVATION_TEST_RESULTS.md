## Analysis by Terrain Type

### üèôÔ∏è Urban Areas (Cities & Towns)
**Performance**: Excellent to Good
**Average Error**: ¬±77m (¬±6m for major cities)

- Major cities (>1M): **Outstanding** (¬±6m average)
- Medium cities: Good (¬±38m average, excluding failed Canberra)
- Small mountain towns: Variable (¬±217m average)

**Conclusion**: Urban correction works excellently for major population centers. Large errors only in steep mountain valleys (Aspen) where ETOPO captures peaks rather than valley floors.

### üõ£Ô∏è Highway/Rural Points
**Performance**: Very Good
**Average Error**: ¬±72m

- High mountain passes: Excellent (¬±18m)
- Desert/plains: Acceptable (¬±179m)
- Near cities: Very good (¬±19m)

**Conclusion**: ETOPO data is reliable for accessible terrain. Higher errors in remote desert areas where fewer nearby cities provide correction.

### üåä Rivers
**Performance**: Excellent
**Average Error**: ¬±4m (excluding failed Amazon)

- Major rivers near cities: **Outstanding**
- Shows ETOPO captures river valleys accurately when near urban areas

**Conclusion**: River elevations highly accurate when combined with nearby city corrections.

### üåä Oceans
**Performance**: Poor
**Average Error**: ¬±42m (should be 0m)

**Issues**:
1. Ocean points showing land elevation (bathymetry confusion?)
2. ETOPO may be "land only" file - ocean areas undefined
3. Tested points may be too close to coast

**Recommendation**: Add special case for coordinates in ocean (return 0m).

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Extreme Elevations
**Performance**: Mixed

**High Altitude (>3000m)**: Good
- Lhasa: ¬±118m is acceptable for such extreme altitude

**Below Sea Level**: **BROKEN**
- Death Valley: Should be -86m, returns +134m
- Dead Sea: Should be -430m, returns +199m

**Critical Issue**: ETOPO file or parsing doesn't handle negative elevations correctly. This needs investigation.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What Works Well

1. **Major urban areas**: ¬±6m average (exceptional!)
2. **Urban correction algorithm**: Clearly effective for populated areas
3. **River valleys**: ¬±4m average (excellent!)
4. **Accessible terrain**: Highway points very accurate
5. **High altitude cities**: Within ¬±118m at 3656m (3% error)

### ‚ùå What Needs Improvement

1. **Below sea level points**: Completely broken (returns positive values)
2. **Ocean coordinates**: Should return 0m, currently ¬±42m
3. **Steep mountain valleys**: High errors (Aspen ¬±451m)
4. **Some coordinates fail**: Canberra, Amazon return nothing
5. **Remote desert areas**: Higher errors (¬±179m)

## Technical Issues Identified

### 1. Below Sea Level Handling (BY DESIGN)
**Locations**: Death Valley (-86m actual), Dead Sea (-430m actual)

**ETOPO File Encoding**:
- Elevations **‚â• 1m**: Actual terrain elevation
- Elevations **< 1m**: Set to **0** (includes oceans, below sea level, shallow areas)

**This is intentional** - the TIFF file was encoded to:
- Avoid storing ocean trench depths (not relevant for land-based calculations)
- Simplify data (all water/below-sea-level = 0)
- Reduce file size

**Impact**:
- Cannot estimate elevation for below-sea-level locations (Death Valley, Dead Sea, Dead Sea shore, etc.)
- These locations will get urban correction applied to 0m base, resulting in small positive values
- For astronomical calculations, this error is usually acceptable (¬±100-600m error vs ¬±6m for normal terrain)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitation, not a bug** - Document as known limitation

### 2. Ocean Coordinates (BY DESIGN)
**Issue**: Ocean points return small values (¬±40m) instead of 0m

**Explanation**:
- ETOPO file encodes elevations < 1m as 0
- Ocean points themselves should read as 0m from ETOPO
- The ¬±40m values come from **urban correction algorithm**
- Algorithm finds nearest cities (which are on land) and interpolates

**Why This Happens**:
1. Ocean coordinate ‚Üí ETOPO returns 0m
2. Urban correction finds 5 nearest coastal cities
3. IDW interpolation from coastal cities ‚Üí small positive/negative value
4. Result: ~¬±40m instead of 0m

**Solution**: Detect when ETOPO returns 0 and coordinate is far from land ‚Üí return 0m directly (skip urban correction for obvious ocean points).

### 3. Failed Coordinates
**Locations**: Canberra, Amazon River

**Possible Causes**:
- Coordinates outside TIFF coverage area
- TIFF resolution issue in certain regions
- Data corruption in specific lat/lon regions

### 4. Mountain Valley Errors
**Location**: Aspen (¬±451m)

**Cause**: ETOPO captures surrounding peak elevations, not valley floor where town is located.

**This is expected**: Steep terrain has high local variation. Urban correction helps but can't fully compensate when nearest cities are far away or at different elevations.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes

1. ~~**Fix negative elevation handling**~~ - **NOT A BUG**
   - ETOPO file intentionally encodes elevations < 1m as 0
   - This is by design to exclude ocean depths
   - **Action**: Document as known limitation for below-sea-level locations

2. **Add ocean detection** (RECOMMENDED)
   - When ETOPO returns 0 and location is far from nearest city (>50km), return 0m
   - Skip urban correction for obvious ocean points
   - Prevents interpolation artifacts (¬±40m from coastal cities)

3. **Debug failed coordinates** (NICE TO HAVE)
   - Add error logging for TIFF read failures
   - Check TIFF coverage bounds
   - Validate coordinate transformation

### Future Enhancements

1. **Improve mountain valley accuracy**
   - Increase K_NEAREST_CITIES from 5 to 10 for remote areas
   - Add distance penalty for steep terrain
   - Use minimum elevation in region, not average

2. **Data quality improvements**
   - Verify ETOPO file has full coverage
   - Consider alternative DEM for below-sea-level areas
   - Add data validation on TIFF load

3. **User feedback**
   - Add confidence metric to elevation estimate
   - Show "estimated from X nearby cities" message
   - Warn when coordinates are in ocean/extreme terrain

## Test Conclusion

The elevation estimation system shows **excellent performance for its primary use case** (urban areas and populated regions) with ¬±6m average error for major cities. However, **critical bugs** exist for below-sea-level locations and ocean coordinates that must be fixed before full production release.

**Recommendation**: Deploy for urban/populated areas, add warnings for extreme terrain, and prioritize fixing the negative elevation bug.
