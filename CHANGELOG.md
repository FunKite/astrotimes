- Fixed broken screenshot link in README.md

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-25

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed project from "astrotimes" to "solunatus" to avoid naming conflict with existing crate
- Updated crate name, binary name, and all documentation to reflect new name "Solunatus"
- Configuration file path changed from `~/.astro_times.json` to `~/.solunatus.json`
- NTP cache file path changed from `~/.astrotimes_ntp_cache.json` to `~/.solunatus_ntp_cache.json`
- Environment variable changed from `ASTROTIMES_SKIP_TIME_SYNC` to `SOLUNATUS_SKIP_TIME_SYNC`
- Benchmark binaries now excluded from `cargo install` (only main `solunatus` binary installed)
- Updated `clap` from 4.5.48 to 4.5.50
- Updated `reqwest` from 0.12.23 to 0.12.24

- Updated `chrono-tz` from 0.9.0 to 0.10.4

### Migration Notes
- Users migrating from astrotimes 0.1.x will need to reconfigure their location settings
- Previous astrotimes versions have been yanked from crates.io
- Install with: `cargo install solunatus`
